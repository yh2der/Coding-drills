# Coding Drills
Hi! My name is Howard. I will use c++ to solve problem from [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/). As I saw a Taiwanese share that we can try to use UMPIRE during coding which is from [CodePath](https://www.codepath.org/)

## UMPIRE法則
### Templates
#### Understand
* Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
* Choose a “happy path” test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs.
* Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs

#### Match
* See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category

#### Plan
* Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode
* Walk through a high-level implementation with an existing diagram

#### Implement
* Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants)

#### Review
* Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples
* Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug

#### Evaluate
* Finish by giving space and run-time complexity
* Discuss any pros and cons of the solution
