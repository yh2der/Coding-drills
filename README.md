## UMPIRE法則
### Understand
* Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
* Choose a “happy path” test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs.
* Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs

### Match
* See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category

### Plan
* Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode
* Walk through a high-level implementation with an existing diagram

### Implement
* Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants)

### Review
* Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples
* Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug

### Evaluate
* Finish by giving space and run-time complexity
* Discuss any pros and cons of the solution
